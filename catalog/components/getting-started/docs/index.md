# Getting Started

This is the developer portal for your organization.  You can access a variety of resources to help you get started with the platform.

## Totally New?
If you are new to the platform, start off by visiting the [Learning Center](http://dev-portal.learningcenter.20-75-114-95.nip.io) to run through some tutorial workshops on how to use the platform.  This environment gives you a sandbox to learn, and experiment without needing anything but your web browser.

## I Know the Basics...
Already comfortable with the basics, and just want to get started on your apps?  Make sure to grab the following prerequisites for your development machine.

* [kubectl CLI](https://network.tanzu.vmware.com)
* [TMC CLI](https://network.tanzu.vmware.com)
* [tilt CLI](https://network.tanzu.vmware.com)
* [Tanzu CLI](https://network.tanzu.vmware.com)

Head over to the [Application Accelerator](https://tap-gui.20-75-114-95.nip.io/create) and select your project type from the catalog to generate a starting project, or assets to add on to your existing project code base to prepare it to run in Tanzu Application Platform.
